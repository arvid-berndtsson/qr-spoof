            A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that consists of black and
            white modules arranged in a square grid. The structure is carefully
            designed to allow for efficient data storage and reliable scanning.

            The arrangement of these components follows a specific pattern to
            ensure reliable scanning and error correction. The finder patterns
            help scanners locate and orient the code, while the alignment
            patterns correct for perspective distortion.

            QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to ensure data integrity.
            This mathematical technique allows the code to be read even if parts
            of it are damaged or obscured.

          <p>
            The error correction process involves encoding the data using a
            generator polynomial and creating parity codewords. During decoding,
            the syndrome polynomial is calculated to detect and correct errors.

            QR codes support multiple encoding modes to efficiently store
            different types of data. Each mode is optimized for specific
            character sets and uses different bit lengths per character.

          <p>
            The encoding process begins with a mode indicator (4 bits) followed
            by a character count indicator. The actual data is then encoded
            according to the selected mode&apos;s rules.

            QR codes come in different versions (sizes) to accommodate varying
            amounts of data. The version number determines the size of the code
            and its data capacity.
